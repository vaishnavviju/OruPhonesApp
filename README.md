I have used GetX provider in order to obtain the listings. I have tried to reduce the number of StatefulWidgets and create more efficient widgets to take less space. I have added cache width and cache height to all the images to reduce the memory usage of the app. I have tried to use the most efficient and clean packages for code building for this app. you can run the apk using 'flutter run' on an emulator or use the apk on your phone. The code here can be forked and executed on VSCODE using run without debugging with an emulator open to view the results.
